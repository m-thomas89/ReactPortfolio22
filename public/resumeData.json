    "bio": "I was born and raised in Queens, New York. I went to University of Michigan where i got my bachelor's degree in Business Administration and a minor in Biology. My goal was to run my own dental school so I went Barry University in Miami where I got my Master's in Biomedical Science. While I was in Miami I found a sales job and started my journey in selling websites for digital marketing agencies. When I moved back to New York I was in charge of running the sales department of an agency that worked with large brands. My goal is to learn how to code websites and tie that in with my selling abilities.",
