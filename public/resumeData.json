My goal was to run my own dental school so I went Barry University in Miami where I got my Master's in Biomedical Science. While I was in Miami I found a sales job and started my journey in selling websites for digital marketing agencies. When I moved back to New York I was in charge of running the sales department of a agency that worked with large brands. My goal is to learn how to code websites and tie that in with my selling abilities.",
